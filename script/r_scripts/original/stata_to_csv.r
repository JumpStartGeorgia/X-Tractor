#! /usr/bin/env Rscript

#######
## this script will generate 4 files
# 1: csv file of data
# 2: spss code file that contains question codes and answers
# 3: csv file of question codes and text
# 4: text file of question answers

## notes
# - the 2nd file contains a list of answers for each question,
#   but does not work properly if the data has values that are not in the specified list of answers.
#   when this occurs, the answers are dropped.
#   that is why the 4th file is needed.
# - currently I cannot figure out how to properly write out to csv in R, so the following files are a hack.
#   - 3rd file format: [1] "Question Code || Question Text"
#   - 4th file format: [1] "Question Code || Answer Value || Answer Text"
#   (additional code will be needed to convert this to csv format)


# five required arguments:
# - 1: stata file to read in
# - 2: csv file to save raw data to
# - 3: spss file to save variable codes to
# - 4: csv file containing variable code and question
# - 5: text file containing answers for questions in a special format

# take in the arguments
args <- commandArgs(TRUE)

print(paste('stata file to read in = ', args[1]))
print(paste('csv file for data = ', args[2]))
print(paste('spss file for codes = ', args[3]))
print(paste('csv file for questions labels = ', args[4]))
print(paste('text file for answers labels = ', args[5]))

# first, read in the data using factors so can generate sps file with answers in them

# read in dta

### old code - was force encoding all questions, answers and data
###          - stopped this because it took a long time to process the data, which is not even necessary
###          - now only process question and answer text
# read dta does not detect encoding and force it to utf8, so have to do it manually
# - this assumes dta files are in windows 1252 encoding
# for (i in 1:length(names(data))){
#   data[[i]] <- iconv(data[[i]], 'CP1252', 'UTF-8', sub="byte")
# }

# basic spss export
# canont use: write.foreign(data, 'out.csv', 'code.sps', package="SPSS")
# for may get error: cannot abbreviate the variable names to eight or fewer letters
# so use the following instead:
foreign:::writeForeignSPSS(data, gsub('.csv$','_bad.csv',args[2]), args[3], varnames=names(data))
