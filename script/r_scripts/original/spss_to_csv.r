#! /usr/bin/env Rscript

#######
## this script will generate 4 files
# 1: csv file of data
# 2: spss code file that contains question codes and answers
# 3: csv file of question codes and text
# 4: text file of question answers

## notes
# - the 2nd file contains a list of answers for each question,
#   but does not work properly if the data has values that are not in the specified list of answers.
#   when this occurs, the answers are dropped.
#   that is why the 4th file is needed.
# - currently I cannot figure out how to properly write out to csv in R, so this file is a hack.
#   each line is formatted as: [1] "Question Code || Answer Value || Answer Text"
#   code will be needed to convert this to csv format


# five required arguments:
# - 1: spss file to read in
# - 2: csv file to save raw data to
# - 3: spss file to save variable codes to
# - 4: csv file containing variable code and question
# - 5: text file containing answers for questions in a special format

# take in the arguments
args <- commandArgs(TRUE)

print(paste('spss file to read in = ', args[1]))
print(paste('csv file for data = ', args[2]))
print(paste('spss file for codes = ', args[3]))
print(paste('csv file for questions labels = ', args[4]))
print(paste('text file for answers labels = ', args[5]))

#############################
# first, read in the data using value labels so can generate sps file with answers in them
#############################
# read in spss
# - need value.label to be true so that label values are available on export
data <- read.spss(args[1], use.value.labels=T, to.data.frame=F)

# basic spss export
# canont use: write.foreign(data, 'out.csv', 'code.sps', package="SPSS")
# for may get error: cannot abbreviate the variable names to eight or fewer letters
# so use the following instead:
foreign:::writeForeignSPSS(data, gsub('.csv$','_bad.csv',args[2]), args[3], varnames=names(data))
#foreign:::writeForeignSPSS(data, args[2], args[3], varnames=attr(data, 'variable.labels'))

# now, read in the data not using value labels so can generate all other files without the code values being changed
