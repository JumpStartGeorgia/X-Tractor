# - 2: csv file to save raw data to
# - 3: csv file containing variable code and question
# - 4: csv file containing answers for questions

# take in the arguments

# record which questions are numeric and which are categorical (factors)
# - is used to convert factor data to numeric
# - and to set the question data type value in the csv
# note - due to the way read.spss works, if the unique list of data answers > the list of possible answers, 
#        the question will be marked as numeric
#        - this could happen if the question is a range of x..y (least .. best) and the data file only
#          defined the least answer and best answer, but nothing in between
